4. Note down your **Customer Template ID**

## Step 4: Get Your Public Key
1. Go to "Account" in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your **Public Key** (User ID)
3. Copy this key

## Step 5: Update the JavaScript Code
In your `scripts.js` file, replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
// Replace these values with your actual EmailJS credentials
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"); // Replace with your Public Key

// In the sendEmailNotifications function, replace:
await emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_ADMIN_TEMPLATE_ID', adminEmailParams);
await emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_CUSTOMER_TEMPLATE_ID', customerEmailParams);

// With your actual IDs:
await emailjs.send('service_xxxxxxx', 'template_xxxxxxx', adminEmailParams);
await emailjs.send('service_xxxxxxx', 'template_xxxxxxx', customerEmailParams);
```

## Step 6: Test the Setup
1. Fill out the form on your website
2. Submit the form
3. Check if you receive the admin notification email
4. Check if the customer receives the thank you email

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure your email service is properly configured
- Check that template IDs are correct
- Verify your public key is correct
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Ensure your email provider allows EmailJS to send emails

## Security Notes
- The public key is safe to use in client-side code
- Never expose your private key in client-side code
- Consider setting up email filters to organize incoming leads
- Monitor your EmailJS usage to stay within free tier limits

## Free Tier Limits
- 200 emails per month
- Upgrade to paid plan for higher limits if needed
